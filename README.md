# CSGirlies-AILAB
A multi-agent interactive experiment simulation system, powered by Wolframi Gitbook and Clone CLI, that allows students to experience physics/chemistry/biology experiments as if they were working with a real partner. The goal: To replicate the real laboratory learning experience at home, even in low-cost environments.
