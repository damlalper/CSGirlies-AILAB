## 💬 Session Transcript

### Partner Agent (Alex) - Initial Greeting
> "Hey! Ready to find that mystery acid concentration? I've already set up the burette with 0.1M NaOH base. Should we start by measuring our acid sample?"

### Student Response
> "Yes! Let's measure 20mL of the acid first."

### Partner Agent (Alex)
> "Perfect! I'm recording: 20.0 mL of unknown HCl. What if we used 25mL instead? Would that affect our equivalence point calculation? 🤔"

### Mentor Agent (Dr. Silva)
> "Good thinking! Before adding more volume, consider what we're actually trying to find. What's the relationship between acid volume and equivalence point?"

### Student Response
> "Oh right! The volume doesn't change the concentration, just the amount of base needed to neutralize it."

### Partner Agent (Alex)
> "Exactly! So we'll stick with 20mL. Now I'm filling the burette with our 0.1M NaOH. Initial reading: 0.0 mL. Ready to start the titration?"

### Student Response
> "Yes, let's begin adding the base slowly."

### Partner Agent (Alex)
> "Adding base drop by drop while swirling... The solution is still clear. What if we added it faster? Would we risk missing the endpoint?"

### Student Response
> "Yes, we need to add it slowly near the equivalence point to catch the exact moment of color change."

### Mentor Agent (Dr. Silva)
> "Excellent understanding! You're demonstrating good technique awareness. What visual cue are we watching for?"

### Student Response
> "The phenolphthalein will turn from colorless to faint pink when we reach the endpoint."

### Partner Agent (Alex)
> "Great! Continuing... 10mL added... 15mL... Getting close... 19mL... There! I see a faint pink color that persists. Final burette reading: 20.2 mL!"

### Student Response
> "So we added 20.2mL of base to neutralize 20.0mL of acid."

## 📊 Student Observations

**Key Insights Captured:**

- **Step 1 Observation:** "Initial acid volume measured as 20.0 mL, burette calibrated at 0.0 mL"
- **Step 2 Observation:** "Color remains clear during early addition of base"
- **Step 3 Observation:** "Need to add base slowly to avoid overshooting endpoint"
- **Step 4 Observation:** "Faint pink color appears at 20.2 mL - this is our equivalence point!"

## 🧮 Wolfram Computational Results

### Calculation Query
```
Titration calculation:
- Acid volume: 20.0 mL
- Base volume at equivalence: 20.2 mL
- Base concentration: 0.1 M
- Calculate acid concentration
```

### Wolfram Results

**Equivalence Point:** 20.0 mL (theoretical)
**Measured Volume:** 20.2 mL
**Percent Error:** 1.0%

**Calculated Acid Concentration:**
```
M₁V₁ = M₂V₂
M₁ × 20.0 mL = 0.1 M × 20.2 mL
M₁ = (0.1 × 20.2) / 20.0
M₁ = 0.101 M
```

**Result:** The unknown HCl concentration is **0.101 M**

### Dynamic pH Curve

   Equivalence Point: 20.0 mL
   pH at Equivalence: 7.0 (neutral - strong acid + strong base)
   Acid Concentration: 0.101 M
```

**Graph Analysis:**
- Sharp vertical rise at equivalence point (characteristic of strong acid-strong base)
- pH = 7.0 at equivalence (both are strong electrolytes)
- Buffer region minimal (not a weak acid-base system)
